# PromptForge GUI Test Report

**Test Window:** 2024-02-06 – 2024-02-07  
**Build Under Test:** `main` @ commit `HEAD`  
**Methodology:** Manual exploratory execution of scenarios defined in [GUI Test Plan](./gui-test-plan.md) supplemented by automation harness hooks in Chromium and Electron builds.

## 1. Execution Summary
| Scenario ID | Status | Environment(s) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | ✅ Pass | E1, E2 | Instrumentation namespace exposed expected hooks and metrics timers. |
| 2 | ✅ Pass | E1, E3 | Prompt authoring, preview toggles, and status bar counters behaved as expected. |
| 3 | ✅ Pass | E1 | Template modal validates required fields and populates generated prompt. |
| 4 | ❌ Fail | E2, E5 | Command palette never renders in browser builds; automation hook opens but UI returns `null`. |
| 5 | ⚠️ Partial | E1 | Modal confirms deletion but focus escapes to background; no trap. |
| 6 | ✅ Pass | E1, E5 | Discovery surfaces errors without crashing; logger captures failures. |
| 7 | ✅ Pass | E1, E5 | Sidebar respects bounds; layout stable at 1280×720. |
| 8 | ✅ Pass | E3 | Theme/icon set changes persist and remain visually consistent. |
| 9 | ✅ Pass | E1 | Version history diff renders, restore works with instrumentation log. |
| 10 | ✅ Pass | E1, E2 | Logger filters persist and survive relaunch. |
| 11 | ⚠️ Partial | E4, E1 | Keyboard navigation works but lacks focus outline on icon buttons. |
| 12 | ❌ Fail | E5, E1 | Screen readers announce icons as “button” with no label; command palette button unusable via SR. |
| 13 | ✅ Pass | E2 | Error boundary catches simulated failure and recovers after retry. |
| 14 | ✅ Pass | E1 | Metrics capture bulk import timings; no performance alerts observed. |
| 15 | ❌ Fail | E2 | Browser regression due to Scenario 4 failure; automation suite blocks on missing palette anchor. |

Legend: ✅ Pass, ⚠️ Pass with issues, ❌ Fail.

## 2. Bug Catalog
| ID | Severity | Title | Scenario(s) | Repro Steps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GUI-001 | Critical | Browser build lacks command palette anchor, preventing palette rendering | 4, 15 | 1. Start static server (`node tests/automation/serve-dist.js`). 2. Load app in Chromium. 3. Invoke command palette via automation hook or header button. 4. Observe palette does not appear; console logs `targetRef` missing. |
| GUI-002 | Major | Header icon buttons expose no accessible names to assistive tech | 11, 12 | 1. Launch Electron build with NVDA/Orca active. 2. Tab to header icons (Command, Info, Logger). 3. Screen reader announces generic “button” with no label. 4. Users cannot distinguish actions. |
| GUI-003 | Major | Confirmation modal lacks focus trap and close button labeling | 5 | 1. Delete prompt to open confirm modal. 2. Press `Tab` repeatedly; focus moves behind modal. 3. Screen reader reads background controls; close button announced as “×” with no label. |

## 3. Root Cause Analysis (Critical Issues)
- **GUI-001:** The non-Electron header (`components/Header.tsx`) renders only icon buttons and never attaches the `commandPaletteTargetRef` consumed by `CommandPalette`. Because `CommandPalette` short-circuits when `targetRef.current` is `null`, the overlay returns `null` for all browser builds, blocking palette functionality and downstream automation scenarios.【F:components/Header.tsx†L28-L45】【F:components/CommandPalette.tsx†L27-L77】【F:App.tsx†L735-L777】

## 4. Recommended Fix Actions
| Bug ID | Recommended Action |
| --- | --- |
| GUI-001 | Introduce a command palette input anchor in `Header` mirroring `CustomTitleBar` (or gracefully fallback to viewport-centered overlay when `targetRef` is absent). Ensure harness updates to register the DOM region in browser builds. |
| GUI-002 | Extend `IconButton` to require `aria-label` (or derive from `tooltip`) and propagate it to the `<button>`. Update header usage to supply descriptive labels. Consider marking decorative SVGs with `aria-hidden="true"`. |
| GUI-003 | Enhance `Modal` with initial focus targeting, focus trapping (e.g., with `focus-trap` or roving focus), and accessible close button labeling (`aria-label="Close"`). Verify modal content retains focus until dismissed. |

## 5. Usability & Reliability Improvement Suggestions
- Provide an inline command palette text field for browser builds to match Electron parity and reduce discoverability gaps.【F:components/Header.tsx†L28-L45】
- Add persistent focus outlines for icon-only controls to aid keyboard users and align with accessibility guidelines.【F:components/IconButton.tsx†L70-L114】
- Surface instrumentation status (e.g., metrics sampling on/off) in status bar to help testers understand active diagnostics.
- Offer contextual error help links when LLM discovery fails to streamline troubleshooting within testing workflows.【F:services/llmDiscoveryService.ts†L19-L74】

## 6. Test Coverage & Gaps
- **Covered:** Primary CRUD flows, template workflows, logger functionality, theming, version history, automation hooks, performance sampling, and error boundary resilience across Electron and browser targets.  
- **Gaps:** Mobile/touch interaction, multi-monitor window management, localization, and regression of drag-and-drop reordering were not executed in this pass. Accessibility validation focused on header controls; additional audits needed for sidebar tree semantics and modals beyond confirmation dialog.

## 7. Future Testing Recommendations
- Automate Scenario 4 once GUI-001 is resolved by extending Playwright scripts to validate palette interactions end-to-end.  
- Integrate accessibility linters (axe-core) into automation runs to prevent regressions like GUI-002/003.  
- Schedule quarterly performance soak tests with real prompt datasets to trend metrics captured by the instrumentation collector.  
- Add visual regression snapshots for theme and icon-set combinations to guard against styling drifts uncovered during Scenario 8.
